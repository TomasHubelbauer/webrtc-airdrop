    <h1>WebRTC AirDrop Signaling Channel</h1>
    <p>
      This page enables information exchange over a WebRTC data channel. The
      peer connection is established completely serverlessly, by using AirDrop
      on iOS and macOS devices to establish a signaling channel and exchanging
      SDP with included ICE candidates (no trickle ICE).

    <p id="offerP hidden">
      Share this page to another iOS/macOS device and then share the page that
      opens there back to the original device to establish the connection.
    </p>
    <p id="answerP hidden">
      Now share this page back to the original device you've shared from.
